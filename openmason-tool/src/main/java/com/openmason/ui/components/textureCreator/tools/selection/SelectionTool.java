 * Interface for selection tools that create selection regions on the canvas.

 * - Interface Segregation: Adds only selection-specific methods to DrawingTool
 * - Open/Closed: New selection tool types can be added without modifying existing code
 *
 * Design Pattern: Template Method (implemented in AbstractSelectionTool)
